Hatbox 1.0 beta 8 Release Notes

- The core library can be compiled with either Java 5 or 6 . The binary for the core library is a Java 5 build,
  but may be run with a Java 6 jre. The hatbox-ui GUI is Java 6 only.

- H2 triggers have been upgraded to support H2 version 1.2 . The hatbox-ui GUI now also supports optional
  provision of the H2 upgrade jar so that the target H2 database is automatically upgraded to v1.2 ODS.
  See http://h2database.com/html/advanced.html#database_upgrade for details.
  
- A new method has been added to the net.sourceforge.hatbox.jts.Proc class to determine the bounds of the
  dataset. This is determined directly from the root node of the index where one exists (without reading
  any data rows) and by a full table scan where an index does not exist.
  A new alias has been added to the H2 set to access the dataset bounds. A Derby function was more
  problematic and has been deferred for the time being.
